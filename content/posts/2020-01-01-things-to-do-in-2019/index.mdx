# My New Year Resolution

Hi, my name is Theo Budiyanto and this is my 2019 checklist. I am trying my best to keep all of it measurable and realistic;
so please help and hold me accountable by pinging me at @tibudiyanto and feel free to ask about these progress. I already shared
some of it on twitter so without further ado, let's break it down shall we?

## 1. Write More

This is something that I've been put aside for awhile. I like writing but I am just not good writer. It sparked again after
I wrote my medium post about saweria. I wanted to commit for a blog post per month; better if it is Indonesian.

## 2. 18 Hours Fast

These past 3 months, I have been doing 16-8 Intermitent Fasting; that is 16 hours of fast and 8 hours of feeding window. I
felt great and I am going to try fasting with 18-6 pattern, starting on the first.

## 3. Stop Buying Cafe's Coffee

I am thinking of limiting myself to a single cup of cafe's coffee per week. I feel like making my own coffee is therapeutic, not to
mention cheaper.

## 4. Maintain Sleep pattern

I am blessed that I can do 8 on most days and I shall keep doing this

## 5. Growing saweria

Well Saweria had a great traction this past few months and I am pretty stoked about its future. I have several plans and I hope
to be able to scale it with 100 MIO IDR of MRR by the end of December.

## 6. Get Married

I cannot believe that it is happening. I am very very excited to be married to my best friend.

## 7. Better Communication

Be a better team player. I feel like I am not communicating better at work; in retrospect I feel like I was being a total jerk.
This is rather hard to meassure but I have to work on this.

## 8. Travel

I love seeing new places and I swear to God these past 2 years I've been very stationary. My goal is to go to a new city every quarter.
