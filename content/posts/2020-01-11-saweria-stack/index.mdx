# Stuff thats powering saweria.co

_"So what does <company_name>'s stack look like?" - me at Cal career fair_

People—past me included—really like asking this question. While its cool to know what other technology people use, it also a sure pathway to flamewars.
If you are nice, the follow up question would be "How was it? What works?", but if you hate life and baby yoda you will ask "WHY NOT USE XXXXX". I really
hope you all love life and baby yoda.

## General Architecture

Our backend is using flask and our frontend is react. Database is Postgres and we have a thin layer of Redis for pub sub. That's pretty much it.

## Frontend

We use react-static to export everything into a static HTML. For styling we used tachyon yet we are moving to Chakra-UI. While tachyons fucks, Chakra-UI plays
much better with React. It is hosted on Netlify. Whats next? We are moving to Now and Next.js. While react-static gives us static page, Next.js will allow us to
be both a server-rendered-app and static app in a same codebase. What to not love?

## Backend

I can hear people say, "WHY PYTHON??". No particular reason other than I am better at python than any other programming language. We are using flask with SQLAlchemy. Nothing fancy here. It is deployed on Digital Ocean $10 droplet
and it never break 10% of CPU utilization. I am debating to downgrade to $5 but I also like to sleep good at night so \$10 it is. We use a simple docker-compose that provision
our flask, redis, and traefik reverse proxy.

## Other Stuff

We use Postgresql.
